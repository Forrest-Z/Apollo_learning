	RTK Replay planning mode with additional planning tasks and driving scenarios
	It's it possible to configure and run planning module in RTK Replay mode with ability to change line or emergency stop to avoid obstacles collision?
	No, you need use standard mode for those functions.

	Hello,

	The following code confuses me, anyone can explain its grammarï¼Ÿ

	[]() -> LocalizationBase* { return new RTKLocalization(); });

	[]()-> means what?
	It is in Localization.cc of apollo1.0 and line 38.

	thanks.

	Its a lambda function with no input parameter and the return object having the type LocalizationBase*. Look up on lambda expressions here

		Steps to reproduce the issue:
		Please use bullet points and include as much details as possible:
		bash ./docker/scripts/dev_start.sh
		bash ./docker/scripts/dev_into.sh
		bash ./apollo.sh build
		bash scripts/bootstrap.sh
		Tasks: Sim Control: ON
		Module Controller: Routing: ON
		Module Controller: Planning: ON
		Default Routing Sunnyvale Loop: ON
		Gives me the screen shot below. Planning automatically OFF.

  // canbus component does not exit gracefully #8053

Describe the bug
As subject

To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

Launch canbus component using mainboard
>>mainboard -d /apollo/modules/canbus/dag/canbus.dag
Shutdown it using Ctrl+C
The console shows:
terminate called without an active exception
Abort 
Cause
No cleanup of those handles: vehicle_controller_, can_receiver_, can_sender_, and can_client_.

Fix
The cyber component has a cleanup hook function called Clear() which will be called inside ComponentBase::Shutdown(). Override of this Clear() function inside CanbusComponent fixes the issue.

void CanbusComponent::Clear() {

  can_sender_.Stop();
  can_receiver_.Stop();
  can_client_->Stop();
  vehicle_controller_->Stop();

  AINFO << "Cleanup Canbus component";
}

There are three relative map mode in apollo 2.5:
Mode 1: perception
Mode 2: navigator + perception
Mode 3: HDMap + navigator + perception.

Does apollo 3.5 also support these modes?

Those modes are not supported in 3.5 yet.



6. // How can I test the control module without a real car?


Apollo version:3.5
I have been trying to test the performance of the sample vehicle lincoln mx8 under a given complex path. After I compiled control_component_test.cc in apollo/modules/control and manually input a straight path which started at (0,0,0) and ended at (4.6,0,0), I found the .INFO file like this:

Now I'm wondering if I have missed some important configuration, or it's just unable to test the control module without a real car (with real GPS message input)?


Not as of now, but stay tuned ! :)
